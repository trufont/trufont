Adrien Tétar is the founder and ultimate authority on the project, but a small number of active contributors actively review each pull request.

Contribute directly to the codebase using GitHub's Pull Requests. 
Learn more in [Github Guides](https://guides.github.com/). 
The basic process is:

- Fork the [TruFont repository](https://github.com/trufont/trufont) on GitHub.
- Using git, commit your changes and push them to your personal fork.
- From the main page of your fork, click on the green “Fork” button in order to submit a Pull Request.
- Your pull request will be tested via [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to automatically indicate that your changes do not break any existing tests. 
- If it reports back that there are problems, you can check the log report for your pull request on Travis to see what the problem was. If you make further commits the Travis system runs again. Note that Travis issue numbers are different from GitHub issue numbers.

After your contribution is included, you should be listed in [CONTRIBUTORS.txt](CONTRIBUTORS.txt) or [AUTHORS.txt](AUTHORS.txt) file.
