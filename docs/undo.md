# What should an undo system be like for TruFont?

## Introduction to Undo Systems

To the best of my knowledge, there are two main strategies to implement undo:

- store snapshots of the data
- record individual change operations or deltas

Snapshot approach, advantages:

- it's fairly simple
- can have periods without undo recording and things still more or less work
- a single snapshot is needed for both undo and redo
- for a group of changes, only a single snapshot is needed

Snapshot approach, disadvantages:

- making a snapshot may be expensive, both in terms of computing as well as
  memory usage
- even for a tiny change, a whole snapshot is needed

Recording individual changes, advantages:

- not more information than necessary is stored onto the undo stack
- small changes are fast to process

Recording individual changes, disadvantages:

- *everything* has to be recorded, or the undo data becomes invalid
- two operations or deltas need to be recorded: forward and backward
  (regular/inverse)
- for a group of changes, all individual changes need to be stored and
  replayed upon undo/redo: for a complex set of changes this can add
  up to a lot of individual operations or deltas

## Implementation

An undo/redo stack is often implemented with as an “undo manager” class,
that is responsible for keeping track of changes, and interaction with
the UI. It sits between the object model and the user interface.

If a snapshot approach is chosen, one could store deltas _between_ the
snapshots, reducing resource usage.

If diffing between versions can be done with text-representations of
objects, the github.com/google/diff-match-patch library may be of
interest; Python’s difflib is not really an option as it only does
diffing, not patching.

Perhaps much of the code can be implemented as a separate library, for
example called “tundo”.

## Considerations about resource usage

Should all undo data be kept in RAM (possibly limiting the number of undo
levels to be kept) or should undo data be flushed to disk, to minimize
RAM usage?

## Factoring

From the perspective of the UI and object code, the undo API should be
simple. Objects may have to provide efficient way to serialize themselves
(either as binary data or as text), but the undo manager will take care
of storing data efficiently. The undo API will have no notion about how
efficiently or inefficiently the undo data is stored. Whether data is
stored in memory or on disk will be completely opaque to the undo client.
This will allow us to build a working system first, and then measure and
optimize for performance and resource usage.

## Undo vs Selection

Undo is not only about the model data, but also selection data: if you do
a step back with undo, the user also expects the selection to be the same
as before. This notion is important because it implies undo data is more
than just serialization of glyph data.

Perhaps the tfont library should support a serialization format that is
specialized for undo, in that it contains selection info. I need to
figure out how this needs to be factored. Perhaps the “converter” concept
can be used.

## Undo vs Redo

Each UndoManager should maintain an undo stack and a redo stack. When
editing data, before the edit is applied, the current version of the data
should be added to the undo stack. Performing undo is also an edit
operation, but it’s special in that the current state of the data is now
added to the redo stack. The design of the undo manager should make
implementing this behavior easy.

## Undo vs Notifications

Depending on how notifications are done in TruFont, some leverage may be
gained from pairing undo with the notification mechanism. A more general
notification system may allow this more easily. (Needs more
investigation: see the trufont.util.tracker module, and how it’s used in
layer.paths.)

The opposite it also possible: to build UI refresh on top of the undo
system.

## Undo Manager API concepts

Flow of events when editing:

- An edit action is about to happen (for example the selection will be
  dragged)
- The undo manager is told the name of the operation (In this case
  “drag”, so the Undo menu can say “Undo drag” instead of just “Undo”)
- The undo manager is supplied with the current state of the data, which
  it will push onto the internal undo stack
- The edit action is handled (the user drags the selection)
- The undo manager is told the edit action is done (not sure this is even
  needed)
- The internal redo stack is cleared

Flow of events when the user does Undo:

- The undo manager is informed that will will perform an undo step. This
  allows to record subsequent edits into the redo stack: it will enter
  redo-mode.
- The undo manager is supplied with the current state of the data, which
  it will push onto the internal redo stack. If the previous action was
  another undo or a redo action, existing serialized data could be
  reused.
- The data of the state to be restored is popped off the undo stack, and
  applied to the live data
- The undo manager is informed that we’re done, allowing it to exit
  redo-mode

Flow of events when the user does Redo:

- The undo manager is informed that will will perform an redo step.
- The undo manager is supplied with the current state of the data, which
  it will push onto the internal undo stack
- The data of the state to be restored is popped off the redo stack, and
  applied to the live data
- The undo manager is informed that we’re done.

The undo manager should have methods to query its state:

- `canUndo()`
- `canRedo()`

Perhaps these methods should not return a boolean, but the operation name
associated with the undo step. Or they could return a (flag, label)
tuple. Or they should be separate methods, just like in NSUndoManager.

There may be a need to coalesce several undo steps into one, or to
otherwise group several undo steps as if they are one.

## What to Undo

There is a need for distinct undo stacks for various items within a font.
For example, each glyph should have its own undo manager, as each glyph
more or less behaves as a separate document. If you edit glyph ‘a’, and
then glyph ‘b’ and then switch back to glyph ‘a’, you want to be able to
undo the latest edits to ‘a’.

Things get nicely complicated if we start thinking about glyph sets: is
the action of deleting glyph ‘a’ part of glyph ‘a’s undo stack, or is
there a separate undo stack for the glyph collection?

Here are some categories of font data that needs undo:

- Glyph/outline data, including metrics
- GlyphSet / Layer data (adding/removing glyphs)
- Font info data (should this be divided into sections? Eg. Naming vs.
  Vertical Metrics)
- Groups data
- Kerning data
- Feature data

## Undo vs wxWidgets

wxWidgets has support for undo via the wxCommandProcessor class. It
largely seems to correspond to our proposed undo manager class. Still,
I'm not convinced using this class will help us a lot, and that a Python
implementation more targeted for our usage (while staying as abstract as
practical) will be more flexible and efficient.

## Things to build

- The undo manager class
- An undo manager storage backend, allowing us to experiment with
  different storage strategies (naive in-memory, diffing in-memory, naive
  on-disk, diffing on-disk)
- A fast serializer for glyph objects, that includes selection info. The
  format should ideally be text, so we can leverage existing text
  diffing/patching tools. I think json would be a good candidate,
  especially since it’s already used in trufont for storage. Perhaps it
  can be built on top of the existing trufont json serializer

## Things to figure out

We need to identify all places in the GUI code that initiate edit
actions, and analyze if things can be rearranged to make implementing
undo as coherent and abstract as practical. Example actions:

- Dragging points
- Adding points/drawing
- Deleting points/contours
- Rearranging contours
- Changing starting point
- Applying path operations
- Slicing with the knife tool
- Using cut/copy/paste
- Applying undo/redo

## To Serialize or Not To Serialize

I’m not yet sure it will be necessary to store undo data on disk instead
of in memory. Perhaps we should focus more on copyability of objects,
rather than serializability. The undo manager could focus more on
actions, and less on serialized objects.

## Actions vs Serialization

To handle the actual undo/redo actions, the "Command Patterns" is commonly
used. [This article](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2471643&seqNum=5)
contains an explanation. In short, it's about tracking commands, and their
inversions. We apply action `xyz` to the object, and action `abc` will
reverse that operation.

This approach should be compared to a more state-based approach, where one
freezes the state of an object, which can then be used to reinstate that
version of the object later. Serialization fits a model of version control
better, but may be less efficient.

## TruFont Qt Undo Manager

The previous generation of TruFont (based on Qt) has an undo manager
written by Adrien Tétar:
github.com/trufont/trufont/blob/master/Lib/trufont/objects/undoManager.py
I don’t think this approach is abstract enough: this undo manager does
work on glyphs, and has no abstraction beyond that.

## BlackFoundry Undo Manager

BlackFoundry started implementing Undo for TrueFont in their fork. So far
it seems to work for most editing operations, but less so for drawing
operations. This work is interesting and should be reviewed more
carefully.

## A data-oriented approach

Raph Levien suggested an alternative approach that focuses on the data, which
works by recording small deltas. This can be done in a generic way, if the
underlying data can be viewed in a generic way — say as a JSON-like structure,
composed of dictionaries, lists, strings and numbers.

His full comment is worth reading and can be found here:

Adrien Tétar responded with some notes here:

Just van Rossum wrote an experimental undo library that explores some of these
ideas, aiming to make it easy to apply on an existing object model in an
unobtrusive way: <https://github.com/justvanrossum/jundo>

## Appendix & Related Topics

### Integrating undo mechanism with version control

A thought from Dave was that undo has some parallels with version
control; the ‘real time fontforge collaboration’ feature he commissioned
many years ago was based on the fontforge undo system. Paraphrasing: Does
it make sense to try to leverage the similarities between undo mechanisms
and version control mechanisms? Could an undo system be built on top of
libraries that are designed for version control?

In my mind, git version control operates at a different granularity than
“normal” editing, and therefore undo items do not correspond directly to
commits. Also, undo items feel “volatile” in terms of UX, whereas git
commits are meant to be there forever. Maybe I’m old school in this
respect, so I’m open to arguments to the contrary. (But that’s not
literally what Dave meant.)

Dave also mentioned mercurial could be interesting for this, as its all
python; and perhaps also the "rope science" articles Raph wrote for the
Xi text editor might also be relevant, along with the Xi undo system.

The Mercurial project should be studied for feasibility of using it for
implementing undo or collaboration. Next step here is to find a good
introduction on using the hg library outside of the Mercurial SCM.

### Real-time Collaboration

Some of the thoughts seem to go into the direction of real-time
collaboration. Perhaps a good example of this is Google Docs: can such an
approach work for font editing, and how should it be integrated into a
tool such as TruFont?

On the one hand this could be a very exciting feature, on the other hand
it calls for a very different approach to “old school” undo management.
In other words: to implement for a desktop app is a very different scope
than to implement a real-time collaboration feature.

Jérémie Hornus wrote: I think a real-time git commit (and more
specifically push&pull) for each and every do action may be too slow and
make the font editor unusable. However there could be some extra layer of
information that could be shared (through version control) at some
strategic action that concern more than one user. We are doing this for
CJK font development at the moment enabling multiple users to work
simultaneously on the same UFO.
