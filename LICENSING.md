TruFont is tightly coupled to the [PyQt5](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt) library by Riverbank Computing, who explain:

> Like Qt itself, Riverbank's software (PyQt5, PyQt4, PyQtChart, PyQtDataVisualization, PyQtPurchasing, dip and QScintilla) is provided under a number of licenses depending on how it is going to be used.
> 
> The free versions are licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3. If your use of Riverbank's software is compatible with the GPL then you do not need to buy a commercial license.
> 
> If your use of Riverbank's software is not compatible with the GPL then you require a commercial license.
> 
> There is no functional difference between the GPL versions and the commercial versions of Riverbank's software.

If you wish to receive TruFont under the GNU LGPL, which permits you to combine it with non-libre software (for example, an extension you develop and intend to sell copies of using a restrictive license) under specific conditions, you must purchase a commercial license for PyQt5 from Riverbank Computing for your use of PyQt5.
